# dictbuilder
## Description
A simple command-line tool for sorting dictionaries and creating markdown pages from these dictionaries using specially formatted JSON files.

## File Format
A raw, JSON dictionary should follow this format. Do not worry about sorting. Dictbuilder can handle that.

``{  
"word1": "This is a definition",  
"word2": "Pretty simple, right?",  
"word3": "I think you get the idea"  
}``
